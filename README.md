# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected routing behavior in Next.js 15's App Router.  When navigating between pages, the application exhibits inconsistent routing, sometimes failing to transition correctly or rendering unexpected content.

## Bug Description

The application, a simple Next.js 15 app, shows the following behavior:

* **Inconsistent Route Transitions**: Navigating between pages does not always produce the expected route change. Sometimes it stays on the current page, other times it jumps to unexpected pages.
* **Unexpected Page Content**: In some cases, the rendered content is incorrect or appears to be a mixture of content from different pages.
* **Error Handling**: A potential error scenario might involve the lack of error handling when the routes do not behave as expected, potentially giving a poor user experience. 

## Solution

The solution might involve:

* **Careful Route Configuration**: Double-check that route configurations in the `app` directory are correct, and ensure any nested routes are properly defined using the app router structure.
* **Data Fetching Optimization**:  Ensure efficient and correct data fetching, especially when the transition involves multiple routes. Consider using loading states to improve user experience while transitions occur.
* **Client-side Route Navigation**:  If the problem is solely based on server-side rendering, consider using client-side navigation using `useRouter` and its `push` or `replace` methods to avoid server-side issues.
* **Debugging**: Using `console.log` to check if all the routes are working as expected. 
* **Framework Updates:** Check for updates to Next.js and address any potential issues that might arise with compatibility, or any other underlying issues.
